# Titanic Linear Regression

This project implements a simple linear regression model to predict Titanic passenger survival based on their age.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3 and necessary libraries installed:

2. Place the `titanic_cleaned_dataset.csv` file in the same directory as the script.

3. Run the script:

The script will output the regression coefficient, intercept, and a plot showing the best fit line against actual survival data.
